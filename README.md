## Team 1 - Best Bytes 
Best Bytes alllows users to submit a food review, further interaction is also available through deleting and updating reviews and so much more.

* Taking life one bite at a time *


## Project Description
We wanted to create a space where food lovers, just like us, can share their food related experiences all in one place. 

This application gives the user the space to add, update and delete reviews to the database - we have created specific classes for this with properties that we deemed to be the most important for creating these reviews.

## Key Features 
Beyond our basic CRUD functionalilty, we decided to implement a few key features to increase the user's ability to interact with the API. These features include a randomisation function to allow to user to find a foodplace at random if they cannot decide where to eat. We also use derived queries to create filters (eg: filter foodplaces based on foodtype among others).

**We have created:** Classes for user, review, foodplace along with their respected services, repositories and controllers.


MVP
- Create user, review and foodplace.
- Read users, reviews and foodplaces.
- Update users, reviews and foodplaces.
- Delete users, reviews and foodplaces.
- Add review method in User to attach a review

Extensions
- Delete review method in User and Review (to allow moderators to also delete inappropriate reviews).
- Average rating method in FoodPlace class.
- Derived queries for filtering User's name, FoodPlace's name, food type and average ratings.
- Changed openingHours: String to openingHour:LocalTime and closingHour: LocalTime.

The quality of a README description often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase:

What your application does 

Why you used the technologies you used,
Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.
