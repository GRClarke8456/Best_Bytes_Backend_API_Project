## Project Description

We have created a back-end project using Java that focuses on food reviews that can be created by the user. Before jumping into our project we created a UML and ERD diagram to help us with planning the project more (there is a file within our repository where you can access these diagrams). We implemented full **CRUD** functionality making it as easy as possible to make changes to our file.  

## What does our application do? 

This application gives user the space to add reviews to the database we have created specific classes for this with properties that we deemed to be the most important for creating these reviews. Through our controllers each class' data is able to be accessed, added to, removed from and updated. 


**We have created:**

Classes: user, review, foodplace 

Services 

Repositories

Controllers 



The quality of a README description often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase:

What your application does 

Why you used the technologies you used,
Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.
