*** Taking life one bite at a time***


## Project Description
We wanted to create a space where food lovers just like us can share their food related experiences all in one place. 

This application gives the user the space to add, update and delete reviews to the database - we have created specific classes for this with properties that we deemed to be the most important for creating these reviews.

## Key Features 


**We have created:**

Classes: user, review, foodplace 

Services 

Repositories

Controllers 



The quality of a README description often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase:

What your application does 

Why you used the technologies you used,
Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.
